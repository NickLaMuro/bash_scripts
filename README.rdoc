= Linux Scripts

These are just some helpful scripts that I thought might be useful for others to use with their own linux boxes.

== mouse_toggle

This script I use to toggle my touchpad on and off.  Its espcially useful when coding and you want to avoid a misclick from your hands resting on the touchpad while typing.

To make this a keyboard shortcut in ubuntu, simply place the script somewhere on your hardrive (I have it in ~/scripts, but the location really doesn't matter).

The go into the keyboard shortcuts and create a new keyboard shortcut.  Call it something like "mouse toggle" and call the command using the full filepath.

A few notes:

You may have to chmod the file to make it work

  chmod u+x mouse_toggle

I also found you can't use the '~' character when calling the script as your command, so you will have to call this script like this:

  /home/<username>/scripts/mouse_toggle

if you are putting this in the home directory.
